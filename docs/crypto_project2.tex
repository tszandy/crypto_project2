	\section{Introduction}
	The quadratic sieve is an efficient method to find many numbers greater $\sqrt{N}$ for some given $N$ whose squares mod $N$ are ``B-smooth'' for a given positive integer $B$. i.e. Let $N,B\in{\mathbb{Z}}$. Find $a^2 \Mod{N}$ s.t. $\forall p_i $ in $a^2 = p^{e_1}_1*p^{e_2}_2*...*p^{e_k}_k$, $p_i \leq B$\\
	
	\subsection{Difference by Squares Factoring}
	Consider the problem of factoring, specifically the method of factoring using difference of squares. If a number $N$ is known to be the difference of two squares, say $N = X^2 - Y^2$, then $N = (X+Y) (X-Y)$. So all we have to do to factor $N$ is to find a number $b$ such that $N + b^2$ is a perfect square. Then $N + b^2 = a^2$, so \[N = a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)\] and we have just factored N.\\
	\\
	
	A random value of $b$ is unlikely to produce a perfect square, but it is fairly likely for a multiple $k$ of $N$ to equal the difference of two squares \[kN = a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)\] such that $(a+b)$ or $(a-b)$, besides for being a factor of $kN$, is also a non-trivial factor of $N$. This means we only need to find a difference of two squares that equals a mutiple of $N$, which is the equivalent of finding $a$ and $b$ such that $a^2\equiv b^2 \Mod{N}$. This fact enables a three step factoring algorithm comprised of:\\\\
	\textbf{Step1}:\\
	\textbf{Step2}: \\
	\textbf{Step3}: \\
	
	Quadratic sieve solves the first step of this algorithm.

	\section{Overview of Quadratic Sieve}
	Explain how quadratic sieve works TODO more info +equations + fix "=" to congruent

		\noindent\textbf{Setup Step}: Given number N and set of primes P, where all elemenet in P >= B, set a=floor of the sqrt(N), set a quadratic polynomial. we will use F(T) = T\^2 - 221.\\

		\noindent\textbf{Step 1}: build a list of F(a) to F(L(a)). TODO define L(), explain why we use it. explain why we start at a.\\

		\noindent\textbf{Step 2}: For i=2 to B, where i=some p in P or is prime factor of some p in P:\\
	
		\noindent\textbf{Step 3}: Predict where division of elem in list by i CAN happen.\\
		if p | F(T), then T\^2 = N mod p has a solution, else no solution so you cant divide by p.\\
		So, if p odd  and T\^2 = N mod p has two solutions, a and b. all mulitples of those solutions can also be divided by the p\\\

		\noindent\textbf{Step 4}: Divide all multiples of the solutions a and b in the list by p\\

		\noindent\textbf{Step 5}: Whenever the quotient of a list element is 1,  it's prime factors are clearly only primes <= B and is thus B-smooth\\
